Learning JavaScript as a first computer language is a challenge. You learn the basic constructs up through object-oriented programming and then you are introduced to what is known as "client-side" JavaScript and the DOM. You go from the typical linear step-by-step process of encoding algorithm's, to manipulating a tree datastructure and writing code that is asynchrous and deals largely with events. It's a huge paradigm shift.

This application is a good introduction to event handling. The user clicks into a field of red, revealing a block of color. The color is randomly generated. Each click invokes another random color until a grid of randomly colored blocks are revealed. See the JavaScript code for comments on how this is done.

Concepts covered: CSS grid; JavaScript random method; assigning multiple elements to a single onclick event using a for loop; the event object and target property.
